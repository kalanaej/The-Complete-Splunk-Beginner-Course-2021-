# Phase 1
	1. Splunk data pipeline consists
		- inputs
		- parsing
		- indexing
		- search
		
	2. We call that IPIS.
	
		* Inputs -: In here, splunk software consumes data. It requires raw data drom source and breaks into 64K blocks and annotates each block with some metadata keys.
				 -: The keys apply to whole input source. They include host source and sourcetype index.
				 -: There are several input categories
						  i) File and Directory inputs - Monitor files and directories in both localy and remotely. Also it can monitor compressed files.
						 ii) Upload                    - upload files to splunk. This option use for one-time analysis.
						iii) MonitorNoHandle           - Available for windows host only. It monitor files and directories in the system that rotates automatically.
						 iV) Network inputs            - Use to send syslog files over TCP or UDP. Also can send data through SNMP events.
						  v) Windows inputs            - Splunk can consume windows event logs, registry data, active directory, Management interface, performance monitoring.
						 vi) Other inputs              - Metrics, Scripted inputs from APIs or message queues, Modular inputs, HTTP event collector.


# Phase 2
	1. There are sevaral ways to configure inputs
		i) Through an app     - When you installed an app, it can have pre-configured inputs. 
	   ii) Through Splunk web - Settings > data inputs, settings > add data
	  iii) Through CLI        - Using splunk commands
	   iv) Through inputs.conf file.
	    v) Through Guided Data Inboarding tool (GDO) - Using data input wizard.
		

# Phase 3
	1. There are two main types of Splunk forwarder.
		 i) Universal forwarder - Collects data from a data source and forwards it to reciever.
								- This forwarder not the part of Splunk. Therefore, this is installed in separatly.
								- This forwarder does not search index or parse any data. It is only captures the data and forwards to something else.
								- To configure this on Splunk, in search bar type "universal forwarder" and then dowload and install. Start the UF.
								- We can setup it which data should collect and to where that data should go.
								
		ii) Heavy forwarder     - This is an advance type of forwarder.
								- This is part of Splunk and can apply through the forwarder lisence.
								- This cannot only forward data but can parse data and route data based on criteria.
								
								
# Phase 5
	1. Go to https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download.html site and click on "Free Splunk". Then go to bottom of the page and download "Splunk Universal Forwarder" 64 bit version.
	2. In installing wizard check all options except Active directory Monitoring.
	3. Give your local login details in next page.
	4. In Recieving Indexer page give your localhost and port number of Splunk. Then install it.
	5. In splunk dashboard click on "Search & Reporting" to check whether universal forwarder working or not.
	6. Click on "Data summary". In host summary, we can see our desktop hostname. In my case it is "splunkmain". Then click on that hostname.
	7. You can see, we are recieving data. This happens cauese of universal forwader.
