# Phase 1
	Steps of deploying Splunk
		1. Splunk deployment models
		2. Splunk storing data on disks
		3. Splunk licensing
		4. Splunk apps and add-ons
		
	Configuration files in Splunk
		- Everything Splunk does is condusted by configuration files.
		- These are text documents that stored in "etc/" location and with ".conf" extension.
		- Configuration levels
			+ System
			+ Global
			+ App
			+ App specific
		- Based on the current app splunk decides wich configurationtype is most suitable. To do that splunk has tool called "B"
		- You never should edit the .conf files in /etc/<app name>/default directory.
		- You can edit .conf files in /etc/<app name>/local directory.

# Phase 2	
	1. Deployment Models
		- There are two type of deployments
			i) cloud deployment.
			ii) On-premise deployment.
			
		- Those deployment types have unlimited scalability. There for it does not matter which option need to be selected.
		
		- Splunk data pipeline
			i) Input -: Splunk consume data from forwards, uploads, monitors or other types.
					 -: In this phase splunk does not look at content of the data.
					 
			ii) Parsing -: This happen on the index or heavy forwader.
						-: In here Splunk --> examine the data.
										  --> Analyzes and transform data.
										  --> Identifies timestamps.
										  --> Annotates the data with metadata.
			iii) Indexing -: In the indexing phase, splunk takes the past data and writes it into indexes
						  -: Splunk calls these indexes as "buckets"
						  
			iv) Searching -: This the phase that users interact with Splunk to search through the data.
		

# Phase 3	
	2. Storing data

		i) Index
			- In splunk, data are store in indexes which is located on disks
			- Splunk call indexes as buckets.
			- Splunk has built in indexes and users also can create custom indexes also.
			- Default indexe use in splunk call "Main".
			- Also, it has another index called "_internal" to store internal logs and other indexes that comes with splunk.
			
		ii) Event
			- Event is a single raw of data
			- Events have fields (key, value)
				 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
				|  key    |  value  |
				|---------|---------|
				|username |	kalana  |
				|username |  John   |
				|-------------------|
			
			- Splunk add default fields to events. Those ara
				+ timestamps
				+ host
				+ source
				+ source type
				
		* In splunk, an index contains compressed raw data from assosiated index files and those index files are spread into different directories by considering their age. Splunk call those directories as buckets
		* There are 6 default buckets and we talk about 5 buckets among them.
		
			1. Hot bucket -: Contains newly indexed data. 
						  -: An index can have one or more hot buckets.
						  -: This is the place that we interact with data (Read/Write)
						  -: Location : $SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/db/*
						  
			2. Warm bucket -: Contains data that rolled from hot bucket with no active writing (Read)
						   -: An index can have many warm buckets.
						   -: Location : $SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/db/*
						   
			3. Cold bucket -: Contain data that rolled from warm bucket and moved to a different location. (Location changed)
						   -: An index can have many cold buckets.
						   -: Location : $SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/colddb/*
						   
			4. Frozen bucket -: Contain data that rolled from cold bucket.
							 -: The indexer deletes frozen buckets by dafault after a period. But you can achive them first if you want.(Delete/Archived)
							 -: Location : You need to specify the location
							 
			5. Thawed bucket -: Contain data that restored from an achive.
							 -: Location : $SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/thaweddb/*
			
			6. Fish bucket -: Not explained in this course.
			
			
		* You can done below things with buckets
			1. Retirement.
			2. Achive.
			3. Back up.
			4. Configure index size.
			5. Partition index data.
			

# Phase 4
	4. Splunk Apps and add-ons
		i) Apps
			- Visualization
			- Analysis
			- Reports and Dashboards
			- User Interfaces
			
		ii) Add-ons
			- Data enrichment
			- Tags
			- Data models
			- Datasets
			
		* App is a collection of Splunk configuration files
		* An add-on is a subset of a app. It specify data collection but do not have any GUI because they are always part of a large app.
		* Splunk app can be found from splunkbase.com
		

# Phase 6
	5. Go to Settings > Licensing. In there, you can manupilate you licensing.
	6. If you purchased any license, you can add that by cliccking "Add license".
	7. If you want to change your license type to heavy forwarder license, you can click "Change license group". Then select "Forwarder license".
	8. If you have other license server you can change your current server by click on "Change to slave" button.
	
	
# Phase 7
	9. To add data, go to Settings > Add Data.
	10. Click "Upload" button to add data. Then upload "homeworkdataset.csv" that given in course work. After that click "Next"
	11. Next tab, Splunk will detect the source type of the columns automatically. However you can edit source type if you want.
	12. If dataset is unstructured, Splunk try to identify patterns on it and add in to key-value pairs. Then click "Next" again to proceed forward.
	13. In this new section, you can view your host name which is your local machine name. However, change that name into "splunkmain" to follow the course easily.
	14. You can also create or change the index type in this section if you want. Then click "Next".
	15. In this new section you can view the summary. If there are any faults go back to previous section and change it. Click "Next".
	16. In this section, you can do given action in the panel or go to your home. Click on "Start Searching" button.
	17. Now, in your left hand side you can view fields browser and right hand side you can view event browser.
	18. In event browser, we can expand any details to get more information.
	

# Phase 8
	1. To install an app, go to home and click on "Find More Apps" that located in left hand side.
	2. Search "AWS" and select "splunk app for AWS" and then install it. You have to give your "Web login" details (NOT LOCAL LOGIN) to proceed.
	3. You can now view your app on splunk home left hand side. Click on the app and click "Acknowledge".
